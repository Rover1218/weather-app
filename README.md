This project allows users to fetch weather information based on city input or current location. It also retrieves images related to the weather conditions using the Pexels API.

## Features

- Automatically fetch weather based on the user's current location.
- Display a 5-day weather forecast.
- Update background images based on weather conditions using the Pexels API.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a modern web browser for testing.
- No additional packages are required, as this project does not use npm.

### API Keys

To keep your API keys secure, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add Your API Keys**:

   ```plaintext
   OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_open_weather_api_key

   ```

3. **Prevent the `.env` File from Being Pushed to GitHub**:

   ```plaintext
   .env
   ```
